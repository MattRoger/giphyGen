# 7 Deadly Sins giphyGen :smiling_imp:
This is page searches giphy and displays the results

## Motivation
Click on a button with a sin in it and the page will search the giphy api for that search term using ajax. The page will display 10 paused gifs. To play a gif, simply click on it, to pause it, click again.

You can also create a sin using the input field. Simply type the sin you want and a button with that sin will appear. Click on the button to see the search results

The goal of this project is to demonstrate usage of javascript functions to call and display an api's search results.
